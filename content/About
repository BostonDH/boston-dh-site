About Boston DH
+++

The Boston Digital Humanities Consortium is an informal association of educational and cultural institutions and individuals in New England committed to the collaborative development of teaching, learning, and scholarship in the digital humanities and computational social sciences. We hope to provide a meeting place and platform to both share DH events and projects in the Boston area, and to engage a public audience with the humanities through digital technology.

The Boston DH Steering Group is a collective of digital humanities practitioners with a yearly call for self-nomination. Co-chairs serve for two years on a rolling basis.
