## About
The Greater Boston Digital Research and Pedagogy Symposium is a regional, one-day gathering of students, scholars, librarians, and other practitioners from the New England area working at the intersection of technology and the humanities. Hosted at a different institution each year, the Symposium provides an opportunity for promoting cross-institutional collaboration and showcases the diverse perspectives of our field.

The 2025 symposium will be held on Friday, April 11 at the Central Library of the Boston Public Library, with select sessions streamed online.

## Areas of interest
The Program Committee welcomes submissions covering a wide variety of topics related to the application of technology, computation, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to humanities research, pedagogy, and professional practice. Proposals on work at any stage in the research process may be submitted.

Given this year’s location at the Boston Public Library, the program committee is especially eager to receive submissions that highlight digital humanities scholarship and projects that intend to reach or engage with a public audience, or submissions that include discussion of the opportunities and challenges associated with developing a public-focused and/or community-engaged practice.

Other themes of particular interest for this year’s symposium include:
* Sustainability, environmental impact, and reducing digital waste
* Digital humanities professional practice, departmental development, and labor
* Preservation of digital objects and scholarship
* AI and humanistic research; implications of large datasets for human and computational use
* Digitization practice and digital collection development in service of digital humanities
* Queering and/or decolonializing digital humanities research and practice
* Digital humanities and the intersection of identity, social justice, and technology
* Digital research and pedagogy highlighting questions of diaspora and indigeneity
