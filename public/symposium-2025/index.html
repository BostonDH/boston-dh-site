<h4>Hold On: Digital Public Humanities in Authoritarian America</h4>
<p>Things are bad. Very, very bad. We don't even need to tell you how bad. In this keynote, Risam will explore the power of digital public humanities for the U.S. today. Drawing on her own collaborative scholarship, she will reflect on the impact that digital public humanities has, particularly in times of crisis. Risam will also offer some strategies for persevering under the present circumstances, such as loss of funding, cultural erasure, and despair.</p>
<p>Roopika Risam is Associate Professor of Digital Humanities and Social Engagement at Dartmouth. Her research focuses on data histories, ethics, and practices at intersections of postcolonial and African diaspora studies, digital humanities, and critical university studies. Risam is the author of New Digital Worlds: Postcolonial Digital Humanities in Theory, Praxis, and Pedagogy, and co-editor of multiple volumes, most recently Anti-Racist Community Engagement (2023) and The Digital Black Atlantic (2021). She is the director of the Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium, founding co-editor of Reviews in Digital Humanities, co-PI of Landback Universities, and co-president of the Association for Computers and the Humanities. Risam is finishing her second book, Insurgent Academics: A Radical Account of Public Humanities (Johns Hopkins University Press), and she is working on a trade book on data and empire.

</p>
        <p>This panel reports on work exploring how a range of technologies has begun to transform our relationship to the human record. Translation can be viewed not as an impenetrable and authoritative record but as a gateway into the original source, whether or not we have been able to study the language. This new environment raises its own challenges and demands that readers cultivate a new set of critical skills so that they can properly assess what they encounter. Those critical skills are, however, an extension of the critical skills that we have cultivated in print culture, with the challenges posed by new digital environments reminding us that those skills are as important as ever.</p> <p>We begin by discussing how non-specialists have used Large Language Models (LLMs) to work directly with untranslated sources in both pre-modern and modern languages. We now have access to multiple LLMS, both commercial and open source, all of which can provide not only translation but also grammatical explanations and translations for each word in a source. In the base model, careful readers compare the output from multiple systems to identify significant divergences and to see how effectively they can assess which (if any) provides the most useful interpretation. We report on performance for Ancient Greek, Latin, Classical Persian, Classical Arabic, and Classical Japanese.</p> <p>AI can also contextualize a vast range of cultural artefacts now available to a global audience: films by Kurosawa at the Internet Archive, a 1940s Indian film about Alexander the Great in India, YouTube videos about Latvian history from a Latvian Pagan metal band. Students of classical works in various traditions around the world have developed, over thousands of years, methods by which to explain culturally alien sources to contemporary audiences. We report about research into these practices and about what we can learn from them as we train new AI-based systems to provide cultural context at scale to millions of sources in far more languages than any human can learn and than any university can currently teach.</p> <p>We report also on the current status of work to aggregate the growing range of services and open data. This includes linguistic annotations, translations and word and phrase level alignments between translation and source texts, named entity classification and linking to authority lists, metrical analyses, links between transcriptions and images of manuscripts and other written sources, and time based alignments between transcriptions and performances. Content includes materials created by human beings, purpose built natural language processing pipelines (like spaCy), and LLMs. We also report on progress towards integrating credits for individual annotations produced by multiple sources from different projects and countries and weaving these into portfolios for individuals.</p> <p>Finally, we report on how this work has shaped the development of, and now benefits from students within, a new Digital Humanities curriculum at Tufts University.</p>

        <h4>Perspectives on Curricula Design for Digital Humanities Programs</h4>
        <p>Sarah Connell, Julia Flanders (Northeastern University); Melanie Hubbard, Antonio LoPiano (Boston College);  Mark Szarko, Ece Turnator (MIT)</p>
        <p>At the recent ACH Greater Boston Area Hub, a discussion on Digital Humanities curricula as it relates to DH certificates and similar programs revealed substantial interest in the subject. In response, our roundtable, comprising representatives from Boston College, MIT, and Northeastern University, will address how we have approached DH curriculum design and how that approach fits within the structure and culture of our DH programs. To lead off the session, each presenter will share very brief details about the DH curricular programs at their institution. The roundtable members will then respond to both pre-circulated questions and questions from the audience, and audience participants will also be invited to share perspectives from their own institutions. Topics will include our perspectives on essential DH knowledge, skills building, navigating institutional and cultural complexities, and addressing students' current and future professional needs. Our intent is to make this an open and dynamic discussion.</p><p>Contributors to this session represent three institutions where digital humanities curricula are very differently positioned and organized. MIT has experimented with several approaches, from a Mellon-funded, Institute-supported Digital Humanities Lab to standalone courses. At Boston College, the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities program is a collaborative effort between the Libraries’ Digital Scholarship Group (DSG) and participating academic departments within the Morrissey College of Arts & Sciences. At Northeastern University, the digital humanities curriculum is sponsored by the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences and is focused on a four-course graduate certificate in digital humanities, which is open to students enrolled in graduate programs at Northeastern and may also be taken as a standalone certificate.</p><p>This session will be an opportunity to explore how these curricula serve different student populations (undergraduate and graduate students from varied disciplinary areas) and different kinds of educational goals. It will also consider the institutional and logistical realities of designing and supporting programs like these: what kinds of courses and staffing are needed? What types of mentoring and support do students need outside the classroom? What kinds of preparation, if any, are students expected to have? What kinds of skills, tools, and methods are the focus of instruction?</p>
        <p>Melanie Hubbard is Head of Digital Scholarship and Data Services and co-directs the Graduate Certificate in Digital Humanities at Boston College. Antonio LoPiano is Digital Humanities Program Specialist at Boston College Library. Ece Turnator is Humanities and Digital Scholarship Librarian at MIT.

        <p>Boston Black Women Lead (BosBWL)  is a project proposed and led by Greater Grove Hall Main Streets (GGHMS) and supported by the Boston Research Center, a Mellon-funded partnership between Northeastern University Library and Boston Public Library's Community History department. BosBWL, builds off the banner initiative on Blue Hill Ave, to highlight and research Black women who have shaped and led Boston from the colonial times to now. This project looks to share information and share these women's works through the creation of Wikipedia articles that can support lifelong learning of folks in Grove Hall, Roxbury, and Mattapan but also nationally and globally with the wide reach of Wikipedia.</p><p>While this project's primary focus is to share the history of Black women leadership in Boston, and secondary purpose has been to contend with Wikipedia's knowledge gaps. Wikipedia’s problems of systemic bias are well known to scholars: it underrepresents both subjects and modes of knowledge-making that fall outside its classically white, male, and Western core demographic. And yet, in the age of AI, Wikipedia’s human-curated articles are more influential and vital than ever. The BosBWL Project asks the question of how community members can use Wikipedia to share knowledge about Black women in Boston? But also how can public libraries, universities, GLAM institutions, and cultural heritage institutions effectively address systemic bias and successfully disrupt racism both on and through Wikipedia?</p><p>This panel will engage audience members in a discussion about designing and maintaining a community public digital humanities efforts, like a Wiki-project.</p><p>Panelists will cover different aspects of this project sharing success, challenges, and lessons learned when community history meets a global community like Wikipedia.</p><p> 
Tieanna Graphenreed will share the BosBWL project's aims and goals, including structural and cultural challenges encountered when bringing Black community history to Wikipedia. Caitlin Pollock will present on the strengths, challenges, and lessons learned of teaching local community history and Wikipedia for an undergraduate course. Halima Haruna will discuss creating a BosBWL Wikipedia-edit-a-thon toolkit and researching the lives of these women for public knowledge and Wikipedia. Lawrence Evalyn will explain Wikipedia’s “immune system” response to newcomers—an effect that can often alienate new contributors—and discuss proactive ways to overcome Wikipedia’s constraints.</p><p>Community histories are more influential and vital than ever. To the question of overcoming Wikipedia’s “immune system” response, community storytelling offers the potential for a cure.</p>

        <h4>Workshop: ARK persistent identifiers: affordable long-term citation and access to digital humanities scholarship</h4>
        <p>John Kunze (Drexel University Metadata Research Center)</p>
        <p>The average URL breaks in 100 days, which is a minor disaster for people who care about durable access to research products and scholarship in digital humanties. Links and citations that fail to access scholarship identified and preserved at great expense undermine all our preservation efforts, and it matters little whether linking to humanities publications, datasets, images, software, maps, training materials, or intangible objects such as vocabulary terms, historical figures, and general linked data.</p><p>This interactive tutorial workshop introduces ARK (Archival Resource Key) persistent identifiers. As non-paywalled PIDs (persistent identifiers, permalinks) for information objects of any kind, ARKs support web addresses that don't break (e.g., that don’t return 404 Page Not Found). ARKs are similar to DOIs used in traditional publishing in that they both were introduced over 24 years ago, exist in large numbers (8.2 billion ARKs, 257 million DOIs), and support research and scholarship, appearing in the Data Citation Index, Wikipedia, ORCiD.org profiles, etc.</p><p>In contrast, ARKs are cheaper, more flexible, and less centralized, letting providers create any kind of metadata and unlimited identifiers without paying for the right to do so, This is vital for under-resourced institutions in the global South.</p><p>Since 2001, billions of ARKs have been created by over 1500 organizations — publishers, libraries, data centers, archives, government agencies, and vendors. Citation-friendly ARKs identify anything digital, physical, or abstract. Important use cases include ARKs for fine art and natural history museums, physical samples, and genealogy. The tutorial includes hands-on experience and is for anyone interested in PIDs supporting nuanced persistence policies.</p>
        <p>John Kunze is a pioneer in the theory and practice of digital libraries. With a background in computer science and mathematics, he wrote open source BSD Unix tools that come pre-installed with Mac and Linux systems.</p><p>He created the ARK (Archival Resource Key), a decentralized, non-paywalled persistent identifier scheme. Since 2001, 8.2 billion ARKs have been created by over 1480 organizations -- national libraries, universities, museums, archives, and journals.</p><p>He contributed heavily to the first standards for URLs (RFC1736, RFC1625, RFC2056), library search and retrieval (Z39.50), archival transfer (BagIt), web archiving (WARC), and Dublin Core metadata (RFC2413, RFC2731, ANSI/NISO Z39.85).</p>

        <h4>Mapping in the Digital Humanities Roundtable: Open, Collaborative and Decolonizing Approaches</h4>
        <p>Tarika Sankar, Khanh Vo, Elizabeth Yalkut (Brown University Library Center for Digital Scholarship)</p>
        <p>The spatial humanities answers the “why” in the “where” in the humanities. While not all geospatial technologies extend beyond their qualitative uses, mapping and the spatial turn in DH can and does produce methods and practices that recognize the reciprocal influences that geographic and constructed spaces have on culture and society.</p><p>This panel will showcase three projects from the Center for Digital Scholarship at Brown University that incorporate digital mapping to create and represent public-facing archives, stories, and databases. Each project demonstrates a slightly different approach to digital mapping and technologies based on the goals and needs of the project, which included community engagement, decolonizing approaches, and cross-institutional collaboration.</p><p>The Stolen Relations project is a community-centered database project that seeks to illuminate and understand the role that enslavement of Indigenous peoples played in settler colonialism over time. Alongside stories and oral histories, mapping visualizes biographical information related to enslaved Indigenous people while recognizing that these Indigenous nations are still here, in New England and all across the Americas.</p><p>In and Out of Place uses a decolonizing, collaborative and Lakotan-centered approach to map scientific and military expeditions that entered the 1868 Treaty Territory in the Black Hills region. The project is a prototype StoryMap tracking Custer’s and other expeditions’ day-by-day travels across Treaty lands, contextualized with newspaper reports, journal entries, and other primary sources. In and Out of Place aims to generate interest and conversation among Lakotan and other Indigenous communities impacted by this history.</p><p>U2 Aerial Photography of Egypt aims to digitize a series of recently declassified aerial photographs that document the Nile Delta and Nile Valley. These images, mapped using Leaflet.js, provide an invaluable view of a landscape prior to the extensive expansion of agriculture and urban development in Egypt that, over the past six decades, has significantly altered the ability to see earlier material remains.</p><p>The projects apply critical questions to the planning, building, and preservation of digital work as well as explore the limitations of mapping tools like ArcGIS and their sometimes incompatibility with humanities data and community-engaged practices. The diversity of approaches to mapping showcased by these projects demonstrates that mapping in digital humanities is rarely one-size-fits-all. By placing these mapping projects in conversation, we hope to highlight the range of tools and methods available today for digital mapping projects and developments in the field of spatial humanities.</p>

        <h4>The Endings Project: Principles and Recommendations Concerning Digital Longevity</h4>
        <p>Ash Clark, Sarah Connell, Julia Flanders (Northeastern University)</p>
        <p>The Endings Project at the University of Victoria has established a set of principles and recommendations concerning “digital longevity”: how to plan and build digital projects in ways that anticipate and ease their eventual conclusion. The Women Writers Project at Northeastern University came to these principles late, but as part of sustainability planning has recently assessed them in relation to the needs of larger digital publication projects, using the WWP publications as test cases. This three-paper session will report on our technical analysis and adaptation of the Endings principles, the implications for the WWP's publications, and the implications for the larger set of projects supported by the Northeastern University Digital Scholarship Group. 
<p>The session will begin with a presentation by Ash Clark focusing on the technical rationale for the Endings Principles and what they are designed to achieve. This presentation will consider how specific components (such as databases, search systems, code libraries, and stylesheets) function and how they affect the longevity and resource consumption of digital projects. It will also lay out the types of static-site approaches that the Endings Project recommends, and lay a conceptual groundwork for the other two presentations.</p>
<p>The second presentation, by Sarah Connell, will focus on the Women Writers Project’s analysis of the Endings Principles, and in particular on how the WWP is moving towards applying these principles to WWP publications as part of the project’s long-term sustainability planning. These publications were designed to make the most of large-scale, dynamic data sets and to enable complex forms of data analysis and visualization. In their current form, although the data has been designed with the Endings Principles strongly in mind, these publications rely on tools such as XML databases and external code libraries which are deprecated by the Endings Principles. They also rely on specific expertise profiles of staff who have been with the project for many years and in some cases decades, but who now are close to retirement. The presentation will take a close look at how the WWP is planning to rearchitect and scale back the technical complexity of its publication platforms, and move the project away from reliance on specific individuals.</p>
<p>The third presentation, by Julia Flanders, will discuss how these issues play out in the larger context of the Digital Scholarship Group. In keeping with the Endings Principles, DSG has generally placed emphasis on high-quality data as the basis for project design and life-cycle planning, but the group is now considering how to manage the use of platforms including WordPress, Omeka, and static-site systems in ways that enable the data to speak effectively through platforms, move gracefully between platforms, and remain visible even after the project is no longer being actively supported.</p>
<p>Ash Clark is the XML Applications Developer in the Digital Scholarship Group at Northeastern University. Sarah Connell is Associate Director of the NULab for Digital Humanities and Computational Social Sciences, and Associate Director of the Women Writers Project at Northeastern University. Julia Flanders is Professor of Practice and Director of the Digital Scholarship Group at Northeastern University.</p>

        <h4>Workshop: How to Build a Framework for Digital Ethnic Courses with Limited Funding</h4>
        <p>Alicia Doyen-Rodríguez (University of Massachusetts Boston), Tarika Sankar (Brown University)</p>
        <p>Workshop Overview
In this workshop I will detail in a very practical manner the process of integrating digital humanities tools and methodologies into college-level courses, a step toward creating a more dynamic and interdisciplinary curriculum for Humanities majors with a focus on ethnic and cultural studies. I will draw on my experience as the recipient of a 5,000$ “Capacity-Building” grant from the Digital Ethnic Futures Consortium (DEFCon) and how I directed the University of Massachusetts – Boston’s successful project to design and implement digital ethnic courses. I expect participants to learn how to maximize and stretch limited resources to incorporate digital technologies into their own teaching practices. I will share with participants free digital resources, grant opportunities, and a framework to develop their own DH curriculum project. Target Audience: Faculty members, curriculum developers, digital humanities specialists, and educational administrators interested in integrating digital tools into ethnic and global cultural studies.</p><p>Learning Objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will:
- Understand how to budget and fund their effort to build digital humanities courses and curriculum.
- Gain specific knowledge around which digital tools we use for course development, including digital mapping, text analysis, and building digital archives (with examples from our own workshop series).
- Explore methods for collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to design inclusive and innovative course content.
- Learn practical strategies for overcoming challenges in curriculum development and faculty collaboration.</p>

        <h4>AI for Accessible Justice: An Affordable and Transparent Legal Solution</h4>
        <p>Peter Nadel, Jill Weinberg (Tufts University)</p>
        <p>This paper presents results of research assessing the efficacy of a novel, transparent LLM designed to analyze legal contracts, specifically social media Terms of Use agreements. Using a large language model (LLM) trained on legal materials, this research incorporates unique interpretability tools that explicitly demonstrate its decision-making process to end users. The research also involved rigorously testing the model's robustness to decipher errors, such as typographical errors, negation manipulations, and legally incorrect content, mimicking a role of an uninformed legal user (i.e., a pro se litigant). In addition to offering a clear assessment of compliance or non-compliance, the research also focuses on precise error identification with user-friendly explanations, qualitative analysis of the AI's decision-making language, and systematic evaluation of potential biases. By advancing the field of explainable AI and promoting responsible implementation, this research contributes to the broader goal of increasing access to justice. This paper also presents a framework for developing AI legal tools that balance effectiveness with user trust through systematic transparency. Findings suggest that transparent AI can significantly improve user trust and accessibility to legal information, particularly for underserved communities.</p>

        <h4>The World Salvage Project: Interdisciplinary Futures and Possibilities for Digital Repositories in the Age of AI</h4>
        <p>Sybil F. Joslyn (Boston University)</p>
        <p>As Professor of the Humanities William Condee noted in 2016, "the arts and humanities are in the midst of an interdisciplinary turn." Coinciding with a nearly 25% drop in awarded humanities degrees in the United States from 2012-2020, this interdisciplinary turn reflects an instinctual need for humanistic disciplines to remain relevant as the academy itself shakes with change. As humanistic disciplines forge new identities, Digital Humanities initiatives should be at the forefront of embracing interdisciplinarity, modernizing humanistic research, and embracing innovative technological tools. In 2024, I created the World Salvage Project (WSP) as a digital data repository to accompany my dissertation on maritime salvage in America's long nineteenth century. Identifying its usefulness to other scholars, I published the WSP as a database-in-progress that unites individual ship records with other associated extant media, from objects and renderings to archaeological records. In my talk, I will introduce the origins of the project as an interdisciplinary repository, the benefits of utilizing Digital Humanities projects as dissertation research tools, and the challenges I have encountered in implementing best practices with limited resources. I will then discuss possible futures for the WSP, including how its development can be served using Artificial Intelligence agents, the importance of open-access and institutional collaboration, and the options that exist to safeguard its data. Through discussing the WSP, I hope to highlight how Digital Humanities initiatives can attract diverse audiences, connect scholars and institutions worldwide, and create a future in which shared knowledge across disciplines drives and aids humanistic research.</p>
        <p>Sybil F. Joslyn is a fifth-year PhD Candidate at Boston University studying American art and material culture in the long nineteenth century. Grounded in object analysis and interdisciplinarity, her research explores the junction between material and visual culture, the social and economic life of objects, and intercultural exchange in the Atlantic World. Sybil's dissertation, "Worth Its Salt: Salvage in the Maritime Visual and Material Culture of America's Long Nineteenth Century," examines maritime salvage as object, material, and process to interrogate conceptions of identity, property, and value during the Age of Sail.</p>

        <p>Kelley Lynch (Brandeis University)</p>
        <p>This talk proposes a modular pipeline for summarizing broadcast news videos, leveraging the power of large language and vision models.  We will detail the integration of Whisper for ASR, TransNetV2 for shot segmentation, LLaVA for image captioning, and LLaMA for generating structured summaries within the CLAMS open-source AI-assisted metadata extraction platform.  A key focus will be demonstrating how combining ASR transcripts with shot-level image captions enhances metadata extraction, effectively addressing challenges such as ASR errors and enabling the generation of more informative summaries.  We will present a comprehensive evaluation of the pipeline using both automated metrics and human assessments, benchmarked against user-generated YouTube descriptions.  This evaluation will offer insights into the strengths and limitations of each evaluation approach.</p>

        <p>Peter Botticelli, Heather Hole (Simmons University School of Library and Information Science)</p>
        <p>We will discuss an early-stage project in which we are exploring ways to expand the options for scholarly engagement with art collections, in both material and digital form. Our initial focus involves working with the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum to investigate the use of digital surrogates for both collection objects and archival records, with the aim to expose hidden contexts and to facilitate new modes of storytelling around the museum. We will present a number of case examples of collection objects and related records in the museum archives, and we will discuss the use of the collection in courses we have developed at Simmons. A larger aim of this work is to examine how digital surrogates can be used to augment as well as to distort the context in which museum objects may be viewed, with the aim to understand how museums might develop or update their access policies to account for AI applications.</p>

        <p>Ashlyn Stewart, Joanna Schroeder, Yuchen Xiong (Tufts University)</p>
        <p>The Boston College Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative has launched a multi-year, interdisciplinary project to extract, structure, and make available data about Catholic institutions from a series of nineteenth-century Catholic almanacs.  Each almanac includes a list of all the Catholic institutions in each of the country's dioceses from that year—every school, hospital, orphanage, asylum and more–including the institution's name, location, and leaders.  Our presentation will include three parts to explain our project in progress, highlighting the choices we have made to improve our dataset, our project workflows, and the experience of our users.  First, Ashlyn will discuss a few key decisions she has had to make about regularizing heterogeneous data from this quirky source.  She will focus on breaking the data into subsets and associating and disambiguating names of individuals in the almanacs.  Next, Joanna will explain how she has improved the project’s data management with automation.  Because the project runs on GoogleSheets, she has used Google Apps Script and the Sheets API to aggregate and standardize data across the project.  For example, she built a system that updates on a daily basis to assign unique IDs to Catholic leaders.  Finally, Yuchen will demonstrate her approach to the interconnectedness of the data and her process of making it searchable. She will illustrate how she has preprocessed the metadata on GoogleSheets with python, built a database with SQL, and created a web interface with Django in order to help web users find specific institutions and individuals.</p><p>*We are submitting two proposals focusing on different parts of this same project.  We would be happy to expand our discussion to fill all or part of a panel, if that helps, or combine our efforts in some way.</p>

        <h4>Building a Digital Trade Archive: Visualizing British East India Company Data (1660–1834)</h4>
        <p>Munirmahedi Paviwala (Boston College)</p>
        <p>This presentation examines the challenges of integrating historical trade data on the British East India Company (EIC) and how visualization can aid historical inquiry. I use datasets from the works of K. N. Chaudhuri and H. V. Bowen which covers the EIC trade from 1660 to 1834. I highlight how the choices made in cleaning and merging can shape the final visualization.</p><p>The talk will outline key decisions made in data integration, including how to deal with missing or fragmented records. I visualise the merged data using Tableau. The mapping of the trade flows reveals patterns and prompts new research questions. The project is open-access, with all data available via GitHub for further collaboration.</p><p>This presentation aligns with the symposium’s themes of public engagement and digital methods in humanities research, showing how historical datasets can serve as a foundation for deeper inquiry. Instead of a singular narrative, my project provides a visualisation that allows historians to study EIC trade networks for their own questions.</p>
        <p>Munirmahedi Paviwala is a historian and digital scholar passionate about making historical research accessible. Munir is currently a PhD student at Boston College, his work focuses on environmental and economic histories of South Asia.

        <h4>Workshop: How to Make a Map Mosaic</h4>
        <p>Ian Spangler (Leventhal Map & Education Center, Boston Public Library)</p>
        <p>Overlaying historic maps in a geographic coordinate system—a process known as “georeferencing”—is an important part of contemporary digital humanities (DH) work. For DH scholars, georeferencing can yield new spatial datasets and provide important spatial and historical contexts to DH projects and workflows. For non-experts and the general public, georeferencing is desirable insofar as people tend to be curious about how places have changed over time, and georeferenced maps make it easier to answer those questions. The Leventhal Center’s Atlascope tool, for instance, provides one way to explore change over time through georeferenced urban atlases.</p><p>But how can you actually go from a digital image of a historic map to a fully georeferenced and mosaicked map overlay? What tools exist for creating these overlays? And how can people, from DH scholars to the general public, get started georeferencing? Participants in this workshop on “How to make a map mosaic” will learn about the core concepts of georeferencing, including 1) basic spatial data models, 2) geospatial theory around georeferencing, 3) how to georeference a map, and 4) how to make a map mosaic (e.g., multiple georeferenced maps “stitched” together).</p><p>The workshop introduces georeferencing with the Allmaps software ecosystem, a set of georeferencing tools that make it easy and more fun to georeference maps without downloading large image files and complex software. Unlike desktop geographic information systems (GIS) such as QGIS, Allmaps allows users to georeference maps entirely in a web browser. By the end of the workshop, participants will be able to independently georeference maps, and will understand basic concepts in geospatial theory around georeferencing (including vector/raster data and data formats, spatial masks/control points, and the IIIF protocol).</p>

        <p>Kelley Kreitz (Pace University); Anindita Basu Sempere, Jamie Folsom (Performant Software)</p>
        <p>The Ground Beneath Our Feet is a place-based, experiential humanities research and curriculum initiative at Pace University that was launched in Fall 2024, with support from a NEH Humanities Initiatives grant and the university’s Student Technology Fee Fund. Students in affiliated courses research and document the history and the communities surrounding Pace campuses, using critical mapping to juxtapose their contemporary, firsthand experiences of Lower Manhattan and the Hudson Valley with their place-centered research. Course topics include New York City's 19th Century Spanish-Language Press, Hurricane Sandy, Counter-Mapping Governance and Community, and Cultural Cartography, and the data and project maps can be related and/or layered to show intersections and differences between datasets. Through custom-built, open source tools, the Ground Beneath Our Feet platform provides support for different types of place-centered storytelling: Places (a searchable map), Posts (essays with embedded places), and Paths (curated sequences of places).</p><p>This talk will describe the overall vision of this project, the supporting technologies, the initial round of critical mapping in the classroom, and next steps based on student and instructor feedback. As we discuss the pedagogical importance of providing multiple tools for combining data and narrative in studies of place, we will also share our process, realizations, successes, and challenges as we seek to empower students to put technology to work for what Ruja Benjamin calls “retooling solidarity, reimagining social justice.”[1] We look forward to sharing ideas and experiences with participants.</p><p>[1] Ruja Benjamin, Race After Technology, (Cambridge, UK: Polity Press, 2019), 160.</p>

        <h4>How the Rhetorical Choices of Syllabi Can Enact Black DH Pedagogy</h4>
        <p>Laura Joy Clarke (Northeastern University)</p>
        <p>The recent publication of books such as Doing Black Digital Humanities with Radical Intentionality by Steele et al. signals a growing concern with teaching DH in thoughtful, student-empowering ways. One easily-overlooked element of pedagogical design is the rhetoric used in syllabi. My research addresses this gap by taking a deep dive into a corpus of DH syllabi: Specifically, I examine their structure and components, as well as sentence-level rhetorical choices to determine how “student-oriented” versus “instructor-oriented” or “content-oriented” these documents are. I unpack how students are discursively constructed in these texts through the nouns and verbs associated with them and discuss the bearing these constructions may have on their perceptions of their own abilities and agency. My corpus contains two sets of syllabi: three from generic “Intro to DH” courses and three from race-focused or Black DH courses. Across all six syllabi, I found examples of the myriad ways that Black DH pedagogies can be enacted (or not) through seemingly simple, even sentence-level decisions. My talk concludes with practical tips and considerations for instructors to implement in their own syllabi. After all, the way we compose our syllabi offers a unique opportunity to begin empowering students before they even set foot in the classroom.</p>

        <h4>Incorporating Undergraduate Students into Large DH Projects</h4>
        <p>Kaitlyn Bell, Nathanael Choi, Ashlyn Stewart (Boston College)</p>
        <p>At the Boston College Libraries, we are fortunate to have twelve undergraduate and two graduate students working on one of the Digital Scholarship Group’s flagship projects (in conjunction with the Catholic Collections Initiative) this semester.  These paid student workers spend anywhere from five to fifteen hours a week extracting, structuring, and manipulating messy data from a series of nineteenth-century Catholic almanacs.  While much of the project is collaborative, we have attempted to break the undergraduates’ work into localized portions so that one student’s progress does not immediately hinge upon another student’s.  This project has tested our project management pipelines, allowing us to learn more about how to manage a dispersed, asynchronous team where almost all of the data creation is done by undergraduate student workers.  Ashlyn will discuss how she incorporates students into the project to suit their individual learning, interests, and strengths.  She will also demonstrate how she oversees and checks their work using mostly GoogleDrive.  Two undergraduate members of the team will join her to share how they have contributed to the project and what they have learned about working on such a large research initiative.  Kaitlyn will discuss her work of improving location information for thousands of institutions, demonstrating the most micro of tasks that our students complete.  At the macro end of the scale, Nathanael will share his efforts in writing and implementing Google Apps Script code across all of the project’s GoogleSheets at once.</p><p>*We are submitting two proposals focusing on different parts of this same project.  We would be happy to expand our discussion to fill all or part of a panel, if that helps, or combine our efforts in 
some way.</p>

        <h4>Public knowledge in crisis: Mining Wikipedia's digital history of the opioid epidemic</h4>
        <p>Rona Aviram (Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel; Learning Planet Institute, Université Paris Cité, France)</p>
        <p>Wikipedia, founded to overcome the limitations of print-based encyclopedias through digital tools like hypertext and open editing, has become a dominant platform for public knowledge-sharing. Previous works by us and others, show it can also serve as a powerful resource for historical research. Our methodology combines traditional and digital humanities approaches, performing systematic diachronic analyses of Wikipedia articles’ text, edit histories, hyperlinks, and references to understand their evolution over time.
Here, we applied these methods to study English Wikipedia's portrayal of the opioid epidemic, a critical and global public health crisis. A custom-built “corpus builder” tool identified 241 relevant Wikipedia articles, extracted their metadata including past edits, contributors, and bibliometric data. This information was qualitatively contextualized to trace the development of key narratives.
Our findings reveal a delayed response in Wikipedia’s coverage of the opioid crisis, with key articles appearing well after the crisis gained public and academic attention. Moreover, treatment discussions primarily focused on drug-based approaches, underplaying the risks of opioid addiction, reflecting a distressing reality. Examining the connections between articles in present and past forms, we found significant knowledge communication failures in the coverage of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, an underrepresented aspect of opioid misuse. 
Our findings highlight gaps in Wikipedia’s coverage of the opioid crisis that reflect broader deficiencies in public discourse and medical policy responses. More broadly, it demonstrates how Wikipedia can be used as a living, digital archive for examining evolving public discourse, and offers reproducible tools for other researchers to capture the incremental growth of knowledge.</p>
        <p>As an early career researcher working at the intersection of digital humanities, history of science and computer science, I explore how scientific knowledge is organized and disseminated digitally. My PhD training was as a wet lab biologist, examining the molecular basis of daily rhythms and sleep. Currently, as a postdoc at the Weizmann Institute's Dept. of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, I am developing computational tools and methodologies to study the broader processes of science-making and knowledge production, and the manner scientific discoveries are reflected in online digital archives, such as Wikipedia.</p>

        <p>The Salus Populi Project is a non-profit digital humanities project based in Liberty, Missouri. We are currently creating a publicly accessible online archive for the pensions of United States Colored Troops veterans who were born or enslaved in the counties of Missouri colloquially known as “Little Dixie.” White residents of these counties enslaved one-third of Missouri’s unfree population, many of whom liberated themselves to serve in the Union Army. After the war, they applied for pensions, and their files contain paperwork related to freedom seekers’ experiences of enslavement, military service, families, disabilities, and community networks. But none of the files are digitized, transcribed, or searchable.</p><p>The Salus Populi Project is partnering with local archives, historical societies, libraries, museums, and descendant communities to digitize, transcribe, and contextualize these records. We are utilizing From the Page, a platform with crowdsourcing capacities, to create a more participatory project. We are also utilizing digital mapping tools to visualize soldiers’ journeys and networks, and partnering with students to narrate stories through short digital films.</p><p>This talk will address the challenges and possibilities we have encountered while creating a digital archive that offers space for descendants, educators, and students to grapple with traumatic histories of racism and grapple with slavery’s legacies.</p>

        <h4>Gone in an Adobe Flash: Five new frameworks to preserve born-computational literary art for the future </h4>
        <p>Ashley Champagne, Khanh Vo (Brown University Library)</p>
        <p>Brown University is the source of some of the earliest, most experimental and innovative works in the field of born-digital literary arts. Faculty and students at Brown regularly produce work in a variety of experimental formats designed for digital environments, from neural-net and model-based aesthetic text-generation programs to fully immersive three-dimensional poetry, and have done so since the early 1960s. Like many institutions, however, Brown University does not yet have models or strategies to preserve many of these works that push boundaries of electronic literature. This talk provides a case study of the university’s New Frameworks to Preserve and Publish Born-Digital Art project, which approaches preservation by focusing (1) on the works that are difficult to preserve in order to determine what approaches will work best for them, and (2) to encourage artists working in these areas to pursue technically innovative art with the knowledge of how to go about sustaining their work for future generations. The talk outlines the preservation frameworks developed for five innovative works that rely on dependencies including Adobe Flash (a technology that recently reached its end of life), aging libraries, browser extensions and broken custom code. The frameworks outlined aim to provide a sustainable future for accessing these five works, as well as a generalized guide for institutions and artists alike in how to preserve difficult, technologically innovative art for future generations. We will also share Brown University Library’s future plans to preserve born-computational work.</p>

        <h4>“A Scientific Association”: New Digital Methods for Understanding the Impacts of Early Women Writers on the Development of Science and Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Melissa Williams (Northeastern University)</p>
        <p>This paper will share insights from a new initiative studying the impacts of women on the sciences during the watershed period of the seventeenth century in Great Britain. The project, led jointly at Northeastern’s campuses in Boston and London, is using text and network analysis to investigate the ways that women scientists and natural philosophers such as Margaret Cavendish shaped emerging scientific and philosophical discourses. In partnership with the PolyGraphs project, we are performing network analysis to study the paths through which these authors circulated their works and ideas, especially in relationship with the networks of cornerstone scientific institutions like the Royal Society. The project is also collaborating with the Women Writers Project to expand the corpus of women’s scientific writing and to analyze this corpus through TEI/XML, topic modeling, word vector modeling, and other methods.</p><p>Preliminary results have already demonstrated the breadth and significance of women writers such as Cavendish, whose reputation for eccentricity has too often overshadowed her substantive engagements with the science of her time, as is made clear through the range of her scientific publications, the extent of her citation networks, and the saturation of scientific discourse not just in her nonfiction but throughout her poetry and plays. This paper will share outcomes from the project’s efforts to enable novel research into this seminal period and to provide new tools for raising the public visibility of women and the sciences, helping to show that women have contributed to scientific and philosophical disciplines since before the beginnings of modernity.</p>

        <h4>Hacking the Archive: Digital Archiving, Activism, and the Future of Public Memory</h4>
        <p>Shireen Zaineb (MIT)</p>
        <p>Engaging with the MIT-based project Hacking the Archive as a case study, this session examines the role of community-driven research and digital technology in creating post-custodial archives. The project aims to build a digital archive that not only highlights the individuals and communities involved in Boston-area social justice actions such as the 1960s anti-highway fight, but also displays the connections between them. In doing so, the session explores three key questions: How can an archive highlighting community connections help us understand and theorize social movement formations? How can a born-digital, networked representation of activism position itself to be accessible to all members of the public? In what ways can an archive of community activists challenge our understanding of time and public memory while also informing future civic actions? In order to address these questions, the presentation explores the methods and strategies developed by Hacking the Archive’s team through cross-institutional and community-oriented collaboration. The project ultimately considers and engages the challenges of establishing a digital, open access archive while maintaining the necessity of publicly available records that preserve and sustain collective memory.</p>
        <p>Shireen Zaineb is a research assistant at MIT’s Hacking the Archive project. Having recently completed her master’s degree in Islamic Studies and Muslim Cultures at Columbia University, her work focuses on the intersection of technology, community collaboration, and liberatory archival practices.

        <h4>Computer Vision for Distant Viewing of Video Materials</h4>
        <p>Owen C. King (GBH Archives); Kyeongmin Rim, Marc Verhagen (Brandeis University)</p>
        <p>Imagine you’re a researcher who has just gained access to the personal manuscripts of a significant but under-studied political leader.  But suppose that, unfortunately, all the boxes and folders are unlabeled, and there is no finding aid for the collection.  How might you even begin?  Media studies scholars face an analogous predicament when attempting to engage collections of digitized videos.  Because analog media deteriorates, digitization efforts for old video tapes are often undertaken under conditions of relative ignorance about the content on those tapes.  The result is digital video files, perhaps with dates and/or titles, but little indication of what the footage actually encompasses.  One could simply watch all the videos, but that is impractical for large collections.  But manually scrubbing through videos is imprecise and error-prone.  Our solution is a system for automatically creating visual indexes of digital videos, for identification and display of scenes with text that identify the persons and places featured in the videos.  The visual indexes are based on a computer vision model we trained to classify scene types, especially scenes with text, from broadcast television, for further processing with language understanding models to pull out personal names.</p> <p>This presentation explains our development and distribution of a system for extracting information and creating visual indexes. This includes: (1) selection of training data (and its limitations), (2) training and evaluating our computer vision model, (3) the multimedia interchange format (MMIF) for storing media annotations, (4) the design of visual indexes, (5) distribution of the models-and-visualization pipeline as an open-source software package. Along the way, we will discuss technical desiderata for time-based and image-based annotation of multimedia in digital humanities research projects.  We will conclude by showing how to acquire and use a software package to create visual indexes for your own digital videos.</p>

        <h4>Building a Platform to host 3D models</h4>
        <p>David Thomas (Boston College)</p>
        <p>The Boston College Libraries Digital Scholarship Group is developing a lightweight, open-source solution for hosting 3D models. The recent uncertainty surrounding Sketchfab's commitment to hosting open-access models has posed significant challenges for universities, libraries, galleries, and museums reliant on such services. In response, our team is creating a user-friendly platform that allows institutions and individual researchers to host 3D models efficiently and affordably, tentatively called RelicQuery.
This solution is designed for flexibility: smaller collections can be  hosted on GitHub Pages, while larger collections can be self-hosted. Users simply upload a folder of models alongside a spreadsheet containing relevant metadata. This approach not only empowers institutions to preserve and share their collections but also enables student research projects to host 3D models without straining university resources.
In this presentation, our developer will demonstrate the platform, explain its functionality, and invite feedback from the community to inform future enhancements. This project represents an exciting step forward in ensuring sustainable, accessible infrastructure for 3D content in the digital humanities.</p>

        <h4>Digital Tools for Ancient Language Research</h4>
        <p>Alicia Tu (Tufts University)</p>
        <p>Ancient language research is much more restricted than modern language research, since there are fewer translators fluent in the ancient languages, and the texts are oftentimes in bad condition. Applying digital tools to ancient language research can help with these problems. With Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tools, texts on fragile copies of books, large monuments, and other materials hard to access and work with can be converted to editable texts in digital forms, making research more convenient while causing less damage to the physical texts when studying them. Large Language Models (LLMs) show high accuracy in translating Classical languages into English, proving useful in providing a basic translation to assist scholars. Finally, digitization and translation should be available online, open for more scholars who do not have direct access to the texts.</p><p>Research done on the Latin and Classical Chinese translations of the Xi’an Stele, accessed from Anthanasius Kircher’s “China Illustrata,” is used as the case study to demonstrate the application of digital tools. Erected in 781 CE, this stele recorded Alopen, the first Assyrian missionary, arriving in China in 635 CE, bringing sacred books and building the first Christian church with other Syriac missionaries with the consent of the Tang dynasty emperor. This research project provides full text online in Latin and Classical Chinese, as well as English translations, compares the accuracy of Kircher’s Latin translations to the original, and spots interesting expressions used when Chinese writers and Western writers adapt to each other’s cultural concepts.</p>
        <p>Alicia Tu graduated from Brandeis University with a BS in Computer Science, a BA in Classics, and a BA in Linguistics in 2023, and is currently pursuing a MA in Digital Tools for Premodern Studies at Tufts University. Her academic interest lies in studying ancient languages (mainly Ancient Greek, Latin, and Classical Chinese) with digital tools and methods. She also works part-time at Special Collections at Tisch Library as a student assistant, and seeks to incorporate more digital methods onto Special Collection books.</p>

        <h4>Tadhg Dall Ó hUiginn: Is é seo mo bhaile (The Ecos of Tadhg Dall Ó hUiginn)- A Decolonial DH Deep Map</h4>
        <p>Melissa Buckheit (Boston College)</p>
        <p>This mapping project seeks to decolonize early modern Irish spaces and places by freeing an Irish language archive of voices, words and narratives, privileging dynamic Irish relationship with and beyond the human, and demonstrating the power of spatiotemporal unity on the ground in an open digital form. This presentation will offer an introduction to these ideas in English and briefly in Irish with both introductions projected as they exist inside the deep map. Then, we’’ll take a short spatiotemporal journey to early modern Ireland—not as a dead past, but a living, vibrant space—wandering across the island and stopping at different ‘’texts’ as they exist and touch inside the map — birds, their habits and songs, castles and their histories and people, bardic poems and their patrons and poets, excerpts of folklore and historical story taken from the Irish Folklore Commission (<a href="http://duchas.ie/">duchas.ie</a>), with accompanying images and the place name or toponymy of Irish places. Our own ‘wandering’ remaps new spaces in relationship with those already mapped online, offering decolonial perspectives on relationships between land, nature and the human. It also demonstrates the plurality and persistence of early modern Irish texts, voices, culture and relationship—and what gains to be lost in a resistance or indifference to listening and thinking in space-time. As early modern literary historian, Pat Palmer argues in Language and Conquest in Early Modern Ireland (Palmer, 2001), a voluble early modern Irish language 'archive' of texts and living voices--represented in Elizabethan English language visual and written texts as silent, and ultimately, silenced--is the product of subsequent and pervasive human inattention to those voices in English language scholarship, as much as the rhetoric and linguistic effects of conquest. Varying facets of this paradigm can reflect the representations and experiences of indigenous peoples, cultures, spaces and languages in the wake of historical conquest; time spent with these early modern Irish voices--human and more-than-human--in a mutuality in place, can help point us to decolonial digital mapping's vibrant, common, and powerful possibilities beyond the island.

<p>The bardic poet, Tadhg Dall O hUiginn (1550-1591), of Leyney, Mayo, Connaught, was one the most prolific poets of the Gaelic literary tradition in early modern Ireland. Writing in the midst of the Tudor conquest in Ireland–a period of extreme violence, social and cultural alteration, dispossession and linguistic colonization–as the bardic poet for a far–reaching range of Gaelic lords and patrons throughout Ulster and Connaught–from Cú Chonnacht Mág Uidhir to Aodh Mág Uidhir, Brian na Múrtha, Aodh Ó Domhnail, Uilliam Burc and Cormac Ó Headghra–Ó hUiginn’s poems often transcend bardic convention and their political, cultural or contractual function as praise or court poems to specific Gaelic families or lords. With a range of expression, subject, imagination, political relationship and music unique among most of his contemporaries, many of his poems mark historical moments and feeling in Gaelic court life, as well as the Gaelic campaign and resistance to colonization by means of singular expressions of relationship with the supernatural, the natural, the mythic, the erotic, the violent and the queer/homosocial. The period of Ó hUiginn’s life which constituted a flourishing in the bardic literary tradition–and his poems, geographical range and relationships throughout Northern Connaught and Southwest Ulster—are the subject of this google digital humanities deep map as an experiment in the radically spatiotemporal, the political and the linguistic plurality of place. As an ecos in flux marked by a sense of chosen relationship or ‘home’ for Ó hUiginn (mo bhaile), this online deep map charts the movement of the poet and his texts in a dynamic rhizome or fractal of early modern Irish land, language, the non-human and inanimate, built and natural environments, history, folklore and toponym—busily functioning despite the upheaval of the Tudor conquest.</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=17o_nT1pkdmGu5P2ABUKhtV0TG4Jht3I">View the map.</a></p>

        <p>This talk explores the challenges of applying computational methods to Arabic texts in the digital humanities, using two ongoing projects on Al-Ghazali’s corpus as case studies. The first project examines the term saʿādah (happiness) to determine whether it is used in a technical or generic sense—a seemingly simple question that proves surprisingly difficult to answer computationally due to the small dataset and the term’s contextual nuances. The second project uses stylometric analysis to determine the authorship of disputed texts, a task that is computationally more straightforward because it relies on larger-scale patterns. By comparing these two projects, this talk highlights how the size and nature of the dataset shape what’s computationally feasible, offering insights into the limitations and possibilities of digital humanities research.</p>

        <h4>Framing Marriage and Fertility in China: A Data Science Analysis of Government Discourse in People’s Daily newspaper</h4>
        <p>Dening Li, Arie Shaus (Mount Holyoke College)</p>
        <p>This project examines how the Chinese government frames marriage and fertility issues in the public sphere through an analysis of People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. While public discourse on fertility policies has been widely studied, the government's strategic communication of these issues remains underexplored. This research addresses this gap by analyzing 18,782 articles (selected using 10 keywords such as “marriage,” “children,” and “family”) from 2013 to 2024—a period marked by major policy shifts from the one-child to two-child and then three-child policies.
Using computational methods—including TF-IDF for term frequency analysis, LDA for topic modeling, concordance in NLTK for context analysis, and semantic analysis with Spacy—this study identifies key themes and shifts in government discourse. Preliminary findings reveal a strategic narrative that portrays marriage as a stabilizing institution and fertility as essential to national progress while downplaying systemic challenges such as gender inequality and economic barriers.
By uncovering how the government constructs and communicates these issues, this project contributes to the understanding of the intersection of policy, culture, and public discourse in China’s demographic transition. It also highlights the government’s role in shaping public perceptions and provides a methodological framework for analyzing large-scale textual data in the digital humanities. Additionally, the findings offer insights into the tensions between traditional values and modern demographic trends, particularly regarding women’s autonomy and societal expectations in contemporary China.</p>
        <p>Dening Li is a Sociology and Data Science student at Mount Holyoke College, specializing in computational text analysis and public sphere research. Her work explores government narratives on fertility in China, gender identity in women’s colleges, and media representations of marginalized groups. She applies NLP techniques such as TF-IDF and topic modeling to analyze large-scale textual data. Beyond research, she has experience as a researcher, teaching assistant, and community dialogue facilitator. Passionate about the intersection of technology and social issues, she seeks to uncover hidden patterns in discourse that shape public perceptions and policy.</p><p>Arie Shaus is a Visiting Assistant Professor in Data Science at Mount Holyoke College and a Research Associate in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.

        <h4>Heterogeneous stylometric features for premodern languages: a case study in the genres and speaking styles of Latin literature</h4>
        <p>Joseph P. Dexter (Northeastern University and University of Macau)</p>
        <p>Premodern languages present a particular set of challenges for work in the digital humanities, notably sparsity of data essential to the use of modern NLP (Blasi et al. 2022, Sommerschield et al. 2023). Research often depends on creative combinations of traditional humanistic knowledge with computational methods (Dexter et al. 2017, Kestemont et al. 2022). As a model of how to pursue such research on a premodern literary corpus, this paper presents a quantitative approach to analyzing genre and speech in Latin literature. We build stylometric profiles of the canonical genres of Latin prose and verse based on the frequencies of function words, syntactic features, and other non-lexical markers, and use machine learning to identify the characteristic features of each genre (Chaudhuri et al. 2019). After this initial analysis, we then apply the same feature set and dimensionality reduction techniques to analyze progressively finer distinctions: authors writing within the same genre, differences between subgenres, and finally the styles of speakers in individual works. In particular, we present an extended case study of the differences between mortal and divine speech in classical Latin epic. We identify key stylistic features that distinguish human and divine speech and discuss the literary significance of an outlying character appearing in a prominent position at the end of Vergil’s Aeneid. Such use of stylometry differs from customary applications in the domains of attribution and dating, and provides an example of how computation can leverage elements of traditional philology to contribute to literary criticism of a premodern corpus.</p>

        <h4>Enhancing Museum Collection Tagging with Convolutional Neural Networks
</h4>
        <p>Eonbi Choi, Arie Shaus (Mount Holyoke College)</p>
        <p>Museums face challenges in efficiently tagging and categorizing their collections, especially as the demand for online access grows while expert resources remain limited. Tags play a crucial role in organizing artworks based on visual elements, themes, and symbolism, helping users navigate collections without requiring specialized knowledge. This study explores the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) models for classifying art images from the Five Colleges Collections Database, a shared resource encompassing objects from six museums in Western Massachusetts. The project evaluates and compares the performance of two CNN architectures, each designed to enhance the classification process. The promising results demonstrate how tagging efficiency can be improved, expanding user accessibility to online collections.</p>
        <p>Eonbi Choi is a senior at Mount Holyoke College, majoring in Statistics and minoring in Computer Science. Her interest in computational approaches to art and culture began last year in a Data Capstone class. A visit to the Mount Holyoke Art Museum during the course led her to reflect on how digital tools can increase accessibility and preserve cultural heritage. In addition to her project in digital humanities, she is also passionate about sports analytics.</p><p>Arie Shaus is a Visiting Assistant Professor in Data Science at Mount Holyoke College and a Research Associate in the Department of Human Evolutionary Biology at Harvard University.

        <h4>From Dugongs to Quetzals to Sequoias: How Global Mythology Quantitatively Embeds Humanity’s Relationship with Nature
</h4>
        <p>Autumn Sehy (Brandeis University)</p>
        <p>This poster presents a computational analysis of nearly 7,000 myths and 200,000 extracted flora and fauna from 1000 species, revealing the ecological structures embedded in global storytelling. Combining NLP techniques—including sentiment analysis, affordance and biological-based feature engineering, part-of-speech tagging, and LLM classification—with biodiversity metrics, this research uncovers how mythologies encode utilitarian and functional relationships between humans and nature.</p><p>Unlike prior AI-driven folklore studies that focus on structuralist tropes (e.g., the Hero’s Journey) or Eurocentric datasets (e.g., Grimm’s Fairy Tales), this study asks: Which species appear, where, and why? It quantifies biodiversity trends, predator-prey balances, and cultural storytelling constraints across continents, exposing deep-rooted patterns in how humanity encodes nature through myth.</p><p>This research began with an accidental discovery: myths can be classified to cultures of origin with Naïve Bayes, logistic regression, and bag-of-words with 87% accuracy—yet when using only mammal features, accuracy plummets to 18%. What drives this gap? By analyzing flora/fauna as cultural signals, this study uncovers striking trends—such as the overrepresentation of predator-prey dynamics and the universal privileging of species with direct human utility (e.g., livestock, medicinal plants, pest controllers).</p><p>Created by a former Glacier National Park guide turned computational linguist, this project provides new evidence that mythology is not just storytelling—it is an encoded ecological record, preserving knowledge about the environment and humanity’s relationship with it across generations.</p>

With a background in machine learning, field ecology, and degrees in English literature and anthropology, she merges NLP with biodiversity metrics to analyze how myths encode humanity’s relationship with nature. Her capstone research spans nearly 7,000 myths and 1,000 species to reveal storytelling’s deep ecological structures. When not obsessing over tree communication, she also investigates rhetoric—collaborating with political scientists to analyze the 118th Congress beyond the left-right spectrum.</p>

        <h4>Intertext.AI: An Augmented Close Reading Interface for Classical Latin using AI for Intertextual Exploration</h4>
        <p>Ashley Gong (Harvard University)</p>
        <p>In the Latin literary tradition, intertextuality—connections between texts that shape meaning and interpretation—is essential for understanding stylistic patterns, thematic nuances, and the relationship between literature, politics, and human culture. However, conducting this advanced humanistic inquiry necessitates specialized knowledge of the Latin canon. To facilitate the development of this domain knowledge for readers, we developed Intertext.AI, a novel digital tool for intertextual analysis that leverages AI to computationally process and search an extensive text dataset. Combining close and distant reading, this system can draw broader literary connections that include voices and texts on the margins of the corpus that receive less attention in existing scholarship, e.g., the comparison of how multiple authors treat women or indigenous populations from antiquity.</p><p>Using vector-based semantic search and interactive text displays, users can query Intertext.AI for contextually similar excerpts across the Latin corpus. A pilot study demonstrated that the interface uncovered textual relationships beyond mere lexical matches by visualizing parallels within their broader context. Further, participants ranging from intermediate to advanced classical Latin backgrounds reported greater confidence and ease of use when using Intertext.AI to find allusions than existing digital tools.</p><p>Intertext.AI enables classicists to explore intertextuality more efficiently and educators to teach students how to engage critically with a network of texts. By approaching literary analysis with human-AI collaboration, this digital platform encourages wider participation in advanced classical studies for online communities of users and enriches close reading with the computational investigation of unexplored and potentially underrepresented textual connections.</p>
        <p>Ashley Gong is a senior at Harvard University studying Classics and Computer Science. Her research explores the intersection of AI and the humanities, focusing on human-centered NLP applications for Latin philology. For her senior thesis, advised by Elena Glassman and Mark Schiefsky, she developed Intertext.AI, an AI-powered interface for intertextual analysis in Latin literature. She is also a research assistant for digital humanities projects in the Harvard Classics Department and Center for Hellenic Studies. Beyond academia, Ashley has interned as a software engineer at LinkedIn and Deloitte, and she will join Watershed Climate as a software engineer after graduation.</p>

        <h4>Activating Digital Archives: Browsing the Bookshops in St. Paul’s Churchyard</h4>
        <p>Mary Erica Zimmer, Ian Frankel, Tristan Hoang, Grace Zhang, Bridget Allan (MIT)</p>
        <p>In 1990, Peter W. M. Blayney’s groundbreaking The Bookshops of Paul’s Cross Churchyard pioneered the field of “book-trade topography,” visually rendering a vital bookselling district of early modern London by tracing aspects of its mapped footprint, as detailed through intersecting print and manuscript documents. While Blayney’s print-based work revolutionized terms in which research might take place, the affordances of digital media allow us to enrich and deepen the archival interface presented by this complex, layered visualization. By providing access to the document-based foundations of Blayney’s maps, Browsing the Bookshops in St. Paul’s Churchyard excavates and complicates the existing scholarly terrain while developing a dynamic, accessible environment to which further researchers can contribute.</p><p>Since 2024, MIT-based undergraduate research teams (UROPs) have engaged the Bookshops project. The range of their research demonstrates this digital environment’s rich potential. Shared by all teams has been the goal of providing access to key documents in multiple genres; here, our transcription and encoding takes place in dialogue with The Map of Early Modern London (MoEML). From this work emerges an interoperable corpus capable of being leveraged to further ends, including studies of gaming, maps and architecture, and the varied, nuanced careers of early modern English female stationers. Our poster will highlight selected developments in the project’s history while bringing forward possibilities for its future.</p>

He is in his second semester of work with the Bookshops project and is currently developing an educational board game based on his research.</p><p>Tristan Hoang is a first-year student within the MIT Concourse Program whose interests include architecture, maps and mapping, photography, and history. He is in his first semester of work with the Bookshops project and is currently exploring engravings within the early modern English book trade.</p><p>Grace Zhang is a first-year student within the MIT Concourse Program whose interests include computer science, mathematics, creative writing, and cultural history. She is in her first semester of work with the Bookshops project and is exploring the work of selected early modern English female stationers.</p><p>Mary Erica Zimmer is a Lecturer in Humanities within the MIT Concourse Program.

        <h4>Coding Change: Women and Minorities in Tech</h4>
        <p>Silvia Rodrigues Follador (Visiting Scholar at WGS MIT; PhD Candidate at FGV EAESP)</p>
        <p>{reprograma}, a feminist NGO, tackles Brazil's stark tech industry disparities by providing free coding bootcamps to women, particularly Black and trans women. It is an example of a market-based solution which seeks to foster social justice, decolonize digital practices, and promote social impact in areas overlooked by conventional public policy and governmental agendas. Despite Brazil's growing ICT sector, where 73,000 jobs were created in 2022 (Brasscom, 2023), women, representing 51% of the population, hold only 39% of these roles. Black women comprise a mere 13% of the IT market (Brasscom, 2022), and trans individuals face extreme marginalization, with only 0.02% reaching college (Benevides, 2022). {reprograma} has successfully graduated 1,622 women since 2016, with an 81.1% completion rate and a 63% employment rate within six months. This research investigates how an intersectional approach influences the capacity building of {reprograma}’s participants and in what way(s) does its collective nature affect the participants’ experience. By analyzing this digital education initiative, this research aims to provide insights into how an intersectional framework can foster inclusive and equitable tech environments and how these success stories can be shared with a wider audience.</p>
